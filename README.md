20) Problem Statement: Hybrid Parallel Programming: OpenMP+MPI for a Complex Application

○ Case: Consider a more complex application (e.g., a simplified climate model or a fluid
dynamics solver). Design a hybrid parallelization strategy using both OpenMP (for
shared-memory parallelism within a node) and MPI (for distributed-memory parallelism
across nodes).

○ Serial Methodology:
■ Understand the structure and computational components of the complex application.

○ Parallel (HPC) Methodology:
■ Identify sections of the application suitable for shared-memory parallelization (within
nodes) and distributed-memory parallelization (across nodes).

■ Implement a hybrid parallel version using OpenMP for intra-node parallelism and MPI
for inter-node parallelism.

■ Evaluate the performance and scalability of the hybrid approach compared to pure
MPI or pure OpenMP (if feasible).
